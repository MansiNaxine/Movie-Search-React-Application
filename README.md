**Personal Movie Search Application Built with React and OMDb API**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Description**

This project showcases a movie search application developed using React. Leveraging the OMDb API, this app allows users to search for movies and view details such as titles, years, and types. I implemented features including:

**Initial Search**: Displays a default set of movies (e.g., “Spiderman”) when the application loads.

**Dynamic Search**: Allows users to search for different movies by title.

**Responsive Design**: Ensures the app is user-friendly and visually appealing on various devices.

**Features**

Search movies by title
Display movie details including title, year, type, and poster
Handle cases with no results gracefully
Feel free to explore the code and see how I implemented the search functionality and UI components in this React application.
